# Depth vs. Depth Plots 


## Choice of Data Depth 

- *Mahalanobis* Depth
- *Half Space* Depth
- *Projection* Depth
- *Simplicial* Depth

Note: Mahalanobis depth does not do well for elliptical and non-elliptical distributions, projection Depth is ideal for elliptical distributions while Half-Space or Simplicial depths do well for non-elliptical distributions.

> In this article, we use Mahalanobis depth to cover the well-studied Gaussian
case, and half-space depth, simplicial depth, and projection
depth to explore the robustness aspect of our approach. The last
three depths are geometric and thus completely nonparametric.
